## Fermihub
Website for displaying Fermi problems.

## Goals
1) Create an easy-to-use and responsive interface for answering Fermi problems
2) Let users submit their own questions, and see statistics on all questions they have submitted

## Configuration
You will need Node.js as well as a MongoDB database.

In config.js.example, provide your database URL, and rename the file to config.js.

To start the application, `npm start`, and to compile any client-side changes, `npm run webpack`.
